# Workshop reservations and a usable manager office

This revision builds on the complete promoted harness from submission
`65e60732-98d2-4765-a2c6-f84076c3e5fe` (0xplemonade, main at `ab1668c`). It reserves a successful workshop site
across workshop types within a controller pass. On open tasks, it also prefers a manager office containing a
built chair, assigning an existing chaired office or zoning over an already built chair. It checks all owned
office zones because the API's manager summary can show an older chairless office while another assigned office
is usable. The inherited model loop and lab-specific office path continue to run.

The new office behavior was checked with a local 35-day diagnostic based on the public LT08 fixture played as an
open task: the leader ended with 13 unvalidated orders; this revision repaired its office on day 7 and had no
unvalidated orders at the horizon. These are mixed-stack games (real DF, fake model), not official results.

# Dining seats, Hamlet wealth, stuck workshops, a lockdown's shut-out citizens and the spring thaw

The model loop, digest and controller are our PR #115 build (pepedesigner's a9f894ea line, with its
wildlife lockdown, no fishing and first-felling wait). This build changes six things. All but the third and
fifth apply to the long open tasks only (MY1, OP1; lab tasks keep the earlier dining and wealth steps and
have no lockdown):

- Dining seats are counted the way DF lists them (a table or chair inside a dining zone, each once),
  dining furniture goes only where a dining zone covers it or can be made, and tables and chairs are
  ordered against that count. GordoAR's coverage check (5dfdcf15) zones a site after placement.
- Full-year games make wood crafts from day 40 while 25 logs are in stock, until created wealth is
  5,500: i34-9's rule (fa9c13cc) for the Hamlet rank.
- A workshop whose construction DF suspended for three days is built again on another site, at most
  twice per type (a core workshop that is missing altogether takes a free site first): no tool resumes a
  suspended job.
- A citizen on the surface when a wildlife lockdown's hatch is due to lock (asleep, or a migrant who
  arrives later) is let in: the nearest hatch that every hostile and large predator in sight is more than
  60 tiles from stays open, or is opened again; it locks when they are below, when the danger comes nearer,
  or after two days, at most three times a lockdown, and at once if invaders take the alert over. The
  alert stays on throughout.
- The civilian alert holds from the last day of winter to the third day of spring (no hatch is locked):
  ice thaws then, and a woodcrafter idle in a frozen river bed drowned at the thaw in a local full-year
  game. A lockdown can still start meanwhile and takes the alert over; the day above ground owed after a
  full lockdown comes first.
- The STATUS digest starts with ALERT lines for dangers to life (a citizen's death or fight with a large
  predator in the latest reports, a large predator in reach of the wagon, citizens shut out), stating the
  lockdown as the observation shows it. Its threats line says that ordinary wild animals are not listed as
  hostiles, and it no longer suggests steps the harness refuses (autochop while the first felling waits,
  the civilian alert, a Fishery or Butchers on a calm fort).
